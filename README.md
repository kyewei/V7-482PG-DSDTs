V7-482PG-DSDTs
==============

Me trying to get 10.9 Mavericks to work on my laptop..

Patched DSDT folder contains the current state of modifications to my DSDT based on v2.24 of my system's ACPI tables. Currently running 10.10.4.

Thanks to the following people for all their hard work, including their patches, kexts, DSDT edits, etc. A specific list of sources and contributions are in sources.md. My specs are in specs.md

More people when they come to mind...
