Note to self: I've removed kexts that I know are easily found elsewhere, including:

Might need -gux_nosleep or -gux_defer_usb2 boot flag

On Yosemite, the IntelHD4k kexts also check for other values in DSDT, so this is needed in addition to the DSDT edits.

Driver for RTL8111 Ethernet, onboard LAN card

Local Time Toggle.pkg

It packages the script explained below. I don't like how on every boot, the system loses a few seconds of time, so I use UTC and removed the script.

Wlan is for the TL-WN725NV2 dongle I have right now. This kext was found somewhere on tonymacx86. 
Update: I found it.

A slightly older one is:

Users found issues with dongle causing freezes. Disabling spotlight (process mdworker) might help.

Patch the AppleIntelFramebufferAzul.kext to correct a small artifact issue with the increased VRAM on the HD4400 (1536 instead of 1024). Alternatively, on Yosemite, making cursor memory to 9MB solves problem.

Update: 
He made a fancy script for this. The injected platform-id is 0x0a260006 (11)
Downgrade frame buffer memory to 16 MB, and VRAM to 1024. Rebuild caches and reboot.

Alternatively, changing a user said changing Color settings to sRGB fixed it also.
