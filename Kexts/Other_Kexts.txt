Note to self: I've removed kexts that I know are easily found elsewhere, including:

Local Time Toggle.pkg

It packages the script explained below. I don't like how on every boot, the system loses a few seconds of time, so I use UTC and removed the script.

Wlan is for the TL-WN725NV2 dongle I have right now. This kext was found somewhere on tonymacx86. 
Update: I found it.

A slightly older one is:

Users found issues with dongle causing freezes. Disabling spotlight (process mdworker) might help.

Patch the AppleIntelFramebufferAzul.kext to correct a small artifact issue with the increased VRAM on the HD4400 (1536 instead of 1024).

Update: 
He made a fancy script for this. The injected platform-id is 0x0a260006 (11)
Downgrade frame buffer memory to 16 MB, and VRAM to 1024. Rebuild caches and reboot.

Alternatively, changing a user said changing Color settings to sRGB fixed it also.
