Note to self: I've removed kexts that I know are easily found elsewhere, including:

Wlan is for the TL-WN725NV2 dongle I have right now. This kext was found somewhere on tonymacx86. A slightly older one is:
http://www.osx86.net/files/file/3539-tp-link-tl-wn723n-v3-tl-wn725n-v2-usb-wifi/
Users found issues with dongle causing freezes. Disabling spotlight (process mdworker) might help.

The patched AppleIntelFramebufferAzul is to hopefully correct a small artifact issue with the increased VRAM on the HD4400 (1536 instead of 1024).
