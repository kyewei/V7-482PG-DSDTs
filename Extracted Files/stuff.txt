If you decompile and get this error:
Store (\_GPE.MMTB (Local2, \_GPE.OSUP (Local2)), Store (Local1, REG6))

It should be this:

Store (\_GPE.MMTB (), Local2)
\_GPE.OSUP (Local2)
Store (Local1, REG6)

Also

Arg0

is supposed to be a method call with Arg0 as the argument. 


The decompiler guessed the wrong number of arguments of those methods. 

I tried to compensate for that by making my own aml file with empty method headers (extra.aml) so that the compiler does pick up the correct number of arguments and decompile correctly. 

Use

iasl -da file1.aml file2.aml file3.aml 

(etc etc) to decompile with the same namespace if you have multiple SSDTS that contain methods referenced in the DSDT.
