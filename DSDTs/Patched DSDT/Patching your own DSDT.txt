Update: I removed the iasl binary.

On OS X, MaciASL is the tool to edit dsdts. It is a wrapper for the program iasl. It is downloadable elsewhere. To update the iasl inside, replace the iasl5 binary with newer versions. Use iAsl version 5 to decompile your DSDT aml if you want fewer errors (which is good!).

If you want to compile the latest version yourself (later versions might give better decompiling abilities...), download the latest UNIX source from https://acpica.org/, extract it, and do the following before compiling using make.

Go to generate/unix, remove the line that contains “-Woverride-init” inside Makefile.config, and execute “make iasl HOST=_APPLE”

Also use flags shown below:
